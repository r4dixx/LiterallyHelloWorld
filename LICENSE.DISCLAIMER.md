NOTE FOR UDACITY STUDENTS

This project was submitted by AmaÃ«l Sikel aka r4dixx, as part of Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree (Google Developer Challenge 2017-2018)

As stated in the Udacity Honor Code and Community Code of Conduct, any project and/or submission must be your own work:

"Any User of the Online Courses agrees that he or she: [...]

will not cheat on any homework assignment or exams for the Online Courses;
will not share solutions to homework assignments or exams; [...] By using Udacity services, you commit yourself to:
notify a Udacity Coach immediately if I become aware of cheating or plagiarism by any Nanodegree student."

Submitting this project as yours will cause you to break the Udacity Honor Code and Community Code of Conduct referenced above and can lead to the suspension of your account.

I, the author of this project, put the whole project code to open-source for help and reference but assumes no responsibility if you get penalized and/or expelled for submitting it as your own.
